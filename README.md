<!-- # Essay
## Current Fellowship at NASA Headquarters
I am currently hosted at NASA Headquarters in the Earth Science Division, focusing on outreach, engagement, and partnerships within the Ecological Conservation program, which funds global projects aimed at biodiversity conservation. My primary goal during this fellowship has been to make NASA's resources more accessible to fisheries and wildlife scientists, managers, and decision-makers. Through my efforts, I have successfully facilitated connections between NASA and these stakeholders, enhancing the impact of our conservation initiatives. 
&#10;## Interest in Science Diplomacy 
I am particularly interested in learning more about science diplomacy to expand my skillset and better engage in international forums. During my fellowship, I have developed strong relationships with conservation leaders and organizations in the U.S., including federal, state, and tribal entities. However, my limited experience in international science diplomacy restricts my effectiveness in global contexts. Understanding science diplomacy will enable me to participate more actively in NASA's international activities, such as IPBES, CoP, and UN subcommittees related to Earth and biodiversity science, thereby enhancing my contributions to these important initiatives.  
&#10; ## Interest in International Collaboration
&#10;My interest in international collaboration, especially with science-policy fellows from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), stems from the recognition of the importance of these regions in global biodiversity. Although my work has predominantly focused on U.S. organizations, NASA funds several projects in the Caribbean and South America. Developing diplomatic and collegial relationships with organizations influencing on-the-ground decision-making and policy in these regions is crucial. By learning to better build and maintain these relationships, I aim to foster effective collaborations that can address shared ecological challenges and promote sustainable conservation efforts across borders. -->
